Principle of Database System

Assignment 6 : Library Database System using MyBatis (Due: July 8th â€“ hard deadline)
 
This is an extension of the library database system we have worked in the previous assignments. Implement a Library Database
Management system using Java MyBatis.  We will use the same library database schema available at library.sql (click to open 
the file). 
Name your program as "LibraryMyBatis.java".  
When you submit, please do NOT Include the database usernames and passwords in the mybatis configuration file. Also, make 
sure to have at least one  domain object and a mapper to map the query results to domain object(s).
Implement the following menu options (queries) in your program. The menu keeps on repeating until the user selects 
the choice 3(Exit).
 
MENU

execution screen shots/test case reports of running your program. Name the main program as LibraryMyBatis.java.
